# Forced-Convection-in-Cooling-Systems-for-Electronic-Components
Computational Thermo-Fluid Dynamics project course aimed at representing forced convection in cooling systems for electronic components thanks to numerical finite-elements analysis.

The repository contains two folders: 
* Code contains all the code necessary to generate the finite-elements model
* Images contains all the figures generated in different conditions and described in the attached report.
